# ENGR200-Computational-Methods
- Introduction to computation methods in engineering usingMATLAB, C, Arduino, and discrete sensors

  # COURSE LEARNING OBJECTIVES
  1. To introduce several numerical methods to solve engineering problems.
  2. To explain sources of error in any engineering design and solution, and the sources of error that we will be mitigating in this course.
  3. To describe the fundamental principles of digital computing, including number representation andarithmetic operations
  4. To introduce the basic operations of the MATLAB and C programing languages as tools to collect,analyze and present data.
  5. To explain how to construct effective, well documented, and error free scripts and functions in MATLAB.
  6. To present how to write computer programs and use toolboxes in software packages.
  7. To present how to develop and execute projects that they create.
  8. To introduce how to model, simulate and build engineering circuits and systems using software packages.
